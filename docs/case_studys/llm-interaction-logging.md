Excellent idea. A side-by-side table with hard numbers makes the comparison stark and immediately understandable. It translates the architectural advantages into tangible, real-world metrics.

Here is the quantitative comparison, designed to be clear and impactful.

CPU intensive.                              | Indexed metadata lookup, reads **~440 MB** of *only relevant* data. CPU light.                           | (The more logs, the higher the factor. This is a conservative estimate.)                                  |
| **Diff Cost (Compare 2 cycles)**                                                      | `Read 2 × 8 MB files + Run diff algorithm`                                       | `Read 2 root blocks + Traverse pointers`                                                                    | **~100x+ Faster**                                                                                       |

| **Client-Side/Edge Sync**                                                             | Requires a complex, custom sync agent (like rsync + logic).                      | **Built-in.** The client is a full Quaternion node and syncs its transaction log with the server.         | **Qualitatively Superior**                                                                              |

### Summary in Human Terms

*   **For Storage:** "Instead of needing a 3 TB hard drive for one hour of work, you would only need about 1.6 TB with Quaternion. Over a day, that's the difference between needing dozens of terabytes and a fraction of that."
*   **For Performance:** "The filesystem approach would be like trying to save a 1,000-page document every second. The computer would quickly fall behind. Quaternion is like saving only the single new sentence you wrote each second, which is instantaneous."
*   **For Analysis:** "Asking the filesystem 'show me every time the AI talked about stocks' would take hours and require reading terabytes of data. With Quaternion, because the structure *is* the index, that same question can be answered in seconds by only looking at the relevant data."
